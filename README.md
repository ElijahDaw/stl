# 3D Print Notes

Recommended slicer settings for these parts.

## Material
- PLA for easiest printing.
- PETG if you want added toughness.

## General Settings
- Layer height: 0.20 mm (0.16 mm for cleaner slot/fit).
- Perimeters (walls): 4 walls (~1.6 mm with a 0.4 mm nozzle).
- Top/Bottom: 5-6 layers each (1.0-1.2 mm).
- Infill: 20-30% grid or gyroid; walls carry most of the load.

## Part Orientation
- Holder: print flange-down so the slot bridges and the bayonet face stays flat. No supports needed if bridging is tuned; otherwise enable supports "touching buildplate" only under the slot.
- Masks: lay flat (plate on the bed); no supports.

## Cooling and Bridging
- PLA: normal part cooling.
- PETG: reduce part cooling to ~40-60%.
- Bridging: ensure bridging settings are tuned so the slot cut bridges cleanly.
